It's okay to provide generic tools "as-is", but for API clients in
particular, we should maintain test suites which verify them against
dummy_responder.  The point is to keep client libraries from
bitrotting when the API changes.

The tests will be run twice to make sure we maintain support for
Python 2 and Python 3.
