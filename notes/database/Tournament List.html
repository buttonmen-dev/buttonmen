Here is a brief (and easliy printable!) list of every licensed Button Man
in the universe, and whether that character is legal in tournaments. This
list is changing all the time, and the current draft is always available
at www.beatpeopleup.com.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Please be aware that every tournament is different, and in fact we encourage
you to run tournaments with different lists than the one given here. This
is only meant as a jumping-off point, a list of those buttons we think are
fair enough to play with.
<P ALIGN=Left>
If you have suggestions for why certain Button Men should be on or off this
list, we want to hear them. Basically, we want to make sure that people who
want a fair game can get one!
