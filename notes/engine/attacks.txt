Attacks are relatively straightforward compared to dice.

Early in each turn, each die on a player's side is asked to list its
attacks. These are saved within the game structure (but not to the DB
-- it's cheap to rebuild this as needed).

Most of these are simple, and you'll end up with something like:

[ "power", (power attack object ref), [ d1ref, d2ref, d4ref ] ],
[ "skill", (skill attack ref), [ d1ref, d2ref, d3ref, d4ref ] ],
[ "speed", (speed attack ref), [ d3ref] ],
...

Attacks that have no dice registered for them won't be in the list at
all.

Then there are things that do an X attack, but do it differently
(Socrates, Warrior dice, Evil dice.)

These will return a different attack type, possibly in addition to the
normal. So, Socrates' dice will all return [ "power", "skill",
"socrates_skill" ], and the attacks array will look like:

[ "power", (power attack), [...] ],
[ "skill", (skill attack), [...] ],
[ "skill", (socrates attack), [...] ]

Meanwhile, warrior dice are returning "warrior_skill", but not
"skill".

(Since I just thought of the question; no, Socrates may not use his
opponent's Warrior dice. They're not in the game yet.)

So we have multiple different attacks that are called "skill" when
describing them to the player, but they aren't actually the same under
the hood. Between that and the validAttack and validTarget methods, I
think we can handle all the weird convolutions of attack types.

(Except maybe evil dice. My best guess of how they work means they
break the "one attack per turn" paradigm, and that will probably need
some special-casing. (Which we might as well genericize as much as
possible. We're already marking dice as having attacked. Have any die
that's so marked return false from validAttack, and after capturing
but before reroll, we can curtail the available attack types as
appropriate, add pass as a valid attack, and loop back to the choose
attackers stage. I'm no longer sure we even need a special attack type
for evil dice, just stuff in their method for when they attack to set
this in motion.))

Anyway, once the list of available attacks is built, each attack
object is asked to look for a valid attack. Once it finds one, it
stops. If it fails, it's removed from the list.

The list of available attack types is passed out to the UI, which
returns a single attack type (or possibly a name), a list of attacking
dice, and a list of targeted dice.

This attack is fed back into the appropriate attack object(s), in
order if there are multiple matches. If they all fail to validate, we
error at the user (possibly logging the error if the front end's
supposed to be checking legality) and kick them back to attack
selection.

So, the attack class probably looks something like this:

Class attack
	FindAttack(game)
		# search through the game to find a legal attack

	ValidateAttack(attackers[], targets[])

	MakeAttack(attackers[], targets[])

	Name

That may actually be it.

The list of main attack types:

Power
Skill
Pass
Berserk (aside from name, this is a straight subclass of speed. The die will cut itself in half.)
Rebound (maybe?? I don't think rebound is actually an attack at all, though it has to cal the victim's isCaptured method)
Shadow
Sleep
Speed
Teleport
Thief
Trip
Hoskins


And my best guess at the list of special variations:

evil_power (maybe)
stealth_skill (don't think this is necessary)
warrior_skill
socrates_skill



Problems with this model:

In general, if an attack involving two weird specialties of skill
would be legal, this method probably can't find it. I'm not sure how
big a problem this is if stealth doesn't use a special attack type,
since at the moment there's just Socrates and Warrior.



Fire dice:

I'm still not sure how to make fire dice work. Treating them a lot
like stinger with hooks in validAttack and capture may be the
best solution.
