# Buttonmen API client and utilities

Buttonmen scripts were written for python2.  We are in the process of migrating them to python3.

Use the scripts with a python installation that contains all modules in requirements.txt.

## Libraries

* bmapi.py: A minimal implementation of the Buttonweavers API, in python (python2, python3)
* bmutils.py: Wrappers for frequently-used API methods, which may repackage the arguments and responses to be more intuitive for users (python2, python3)
* random_ai.py: A client which can play a buttonmen game containing any implemented button skills (not strategically), by taking legal random actions until the game ends.  Used for replay testing (python2 only)

## User scripts

These scripts have been provided by players over time, and are not tested.  Use at your own risk.
