Utility directory for Grunt, the javascript task runner:
  http://gruntjs.com/

At the moment, this can be used for linting of javascript files in
the buttonmen source tree.  It may be used for other javascript
tasks in the future.

To install the grunt utilities to perform linting in your working
directory:
 * Install npm (the node.js package manager) on your system
 * Run: ./npm_install_grunt
This will place the needed utilities in your ./node_modules directory.
Please do not check ./node_modules into git!

Once you have grunt installed in your working directory, to run the
lint check, use:
  ./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt
(or simply "grunt", if you have grunt centrally installed on this
system.)


Note: this should work correctly if you execute grunt while in this
directory, but is not guaranteed to work if you cd elsewhere.  The
.jshintrc file and node_modules which grunt uses will be here, and
the config files specify the directories to lint relative to this
directory.
