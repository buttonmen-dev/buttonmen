Utility directory for Grunt, the javascript task runner:
  http://gruntjs.com/

At the moment, this can be used for linting of javascript files in
the buttonmen source tree.  It may be used for other javascript
tasks in the future.

To install the grunt utilities to perform linting in your working
directory:
 * Install npm (the node.js package manager) on your system
 * Run: ./npm_install_grunt
This will place the needed utilities in your ./node_modules directory.
Please do not check ./node_modules into git! 

Once you have grunt installed in your working directory, to run the
lint check, use:
  ./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt inlinelint
