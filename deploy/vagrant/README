Configuration of the "vagrant" automated VM deployment tool to
create a runnable test instance of the buttonmen site.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to start an instance:

 1. (one-time) Install vagrant: download a recent version of vagrant from
      http://www.vagrantup.com/
    and install it.  (So far, this has been successfully tested
    using Vagrant 1.2.7 on Mac OS X 10.8.)

 2. In your shell, cd into this directory in your checked out repo:
      cd .../deploy/vagrant

 3. Initialize the repo:
      vagrant up
    This will take some time, probably several minutes.  The file
    README.vagrant-up-example is an example of what you might see
    on your screen during a successful invocation.

    The very first time you run this, it will take longer, because
    it needs to download a copy of the Ubuntu VM which it will
    customize to make your test VM.

 4. Use the site: using a web browser, go to:

      http://localhost:8080/

    You should see an instance of the buttonmen site with a clean
    database.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things you might want to do after you have a running instance:

 * Tear down your instance entirely, e.g. to start over:

     vagrant destroy

 * Reboot the VM and resynchronize the buttonmen code from your
   working directory:

     vagrant reload

 * Shut down the VM so it can be booted again later:

     vagrant halt

 * Find out other options:

     vagrant help

 * Login to your instance and edit buttonmen code by hand:

     vagrant ssh
     cd /var/www
     # edit code by hand using your favorite Unix text editor
     sudo service apache2 reload   # just to make sure no old code is cached

 * Run the test suites that run on pagodabox:

     cd /buttonmen/src
     php /usr/local/etc/buttonmen_phpunit.php /buttonmen/test
