Without the Crab, Rokugan would be in flames.<br><br>You are a young samurai of the Crab Clan, already battle-hardened by fending off massed Shadowlands assaults upon the Kaiu Walls. You have no time for niceties or etiquette", CHAR(59), " you guzzle water from a bucket and have no interest in sipping tea from a tiny porcelain cup.<br><br>Since the self-sacrifice of your heroic daimyo Hida Yakamo, his younger sister, Hida O-Ushi, has become leader of the Crab. She is a worthy samurai, dark and beautiful, and is never seen without her hammer slung casually over her shoulder. Though feared far and wide as \"the bully,\" you know she has a quick (if dark) sense of humor and is a very capable leader and expert fighter.<br><br>It is for her sake that you have entered the Test of the Topaz Champion.
